A machine learning algorithm built using Neural Networks to predict the stock prices of Netflix. 

Developed using an intensive dataset of Netflix stock prices and libraries such as tensorflow in a Jupyter Notebook environment with relevant data cleaning, pre-processing and training and testing as well as hyper tuning parameters to find the best possible performance for the model resulting in a highly accurate model at predicting stock prices.
